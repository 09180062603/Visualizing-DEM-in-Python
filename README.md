# 🌍 DEM Download & Visualization using Google Earth Engine & Python 🛰️  

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates how to efficiently **download Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from Google Earth Engine (GEE)** and **visualize it in Python**. By clipping the DEM to a specific region, we **reduce file size** and make processing in Python much faster.  

The project consists of two main steps:  
✅ **Step 1:** Extract and download DEM data from **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** in **GeoTIFF format**.  
✅ **Step 2:** Process and visualize the DEM in **Python** using `Rasterio`, `Matplotlib`, and `Geopandas`.

## 🚀 Features  
✔ Download DEM for a specific region instead of the entire dataset  
✔ Convert DEM coordinate system to **WGS84 (EPSG:4326)**  
✔ Overlay a **shapefile boundary** on the DEM  
✔ Add a **color scale, scale bar, and north arrow** to the map  
✔ Save the final **DEM visualization as a high-quality image**
